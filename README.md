OBTranslate is a Client-Server program written in Java by Bryan Martin and Owen Enders.
This represents our final project for the 2016 Spring Semester of Network Programming (CSI-235-01).

The server in this program will recieve text from the client, determine the language, and translate to whatever langauge the user specifies.

If you want to try out OBTranslate or make changes:
1. Download/Clone the code
2. Open both programs in the IDE of your choice if you wish to make changes (I recomend opening OBTranslate as a "Project Group" in Netbeans)
3. Run OBTranslateServer
4. Run OBTranslateClient
5. Follow the instructions on the client!
6. Feel free to check out the Server output also, it narrates most of what it does
