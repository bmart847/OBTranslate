Assignment: Final Project - OBTranslate
Due Date: 04/24/2016
Description:
    The OBTranslateServer acts as a relay between the users of OBTranslateClient
and Yandex (the translation service we are using). The server recieves the text
that the user desires to translate and then responds to the user with the
translated text.

    I certify that this is entirely my own work, except where I have given fullydocumented
    references to the work of others. I understand the definition and
    consequences of plagiarism and acknowledge that the assessor of this assignment
    may, for the purpose of assessing this assignment:

    (which may then retain a copy of this assignment on its database for
    the purpose of future plagiarism checking)
